# Cluster DNS Operator

Cluster DNS Operator deploys and manages [CoreDNS](https://coredns.io) to provide a name resolution service to pods that enables [DNS-based Kubernetes Service discovery](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#dns) in [OpenShift](https://openshift.io).

The operator tries to be useful out of the box by creating a working default deployment based on the cluster's configuration.

* The default cluster domain is `cluster.local`.
* Configuration of the CoreDNS [Corefile](https://coredns.io/manual/toc/#configuration) or [kubernetes plugin](https://coredns.io/plugins/kubernetes/) is not yet supported.

## How it works

Cluster DNS Operator manages CoreDNS as a Kubernetes DaemonSet exposed as a Service with a static IP â€” CoreDNS runs on all nodes in the cluster.
